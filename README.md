- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @radoslav-nikolov,
-  I am a self-motivated, goal-oriented and conscientious web developer, a professional with a proven track record of delivering projects and providing support. I demonstrate excellent communication skills with the ability to relate at all professional levels, building understanding and developing solid relationships. Highly organised and efficient, managing large workloads and prioritizing tasks to meet deadlines. Long-term professional career experience and participation in projects of various scale and complexity, as well as team management, give me the self-confidence of a well-organised, motivated, result-oriented person as a leader and manager of teams and projects.
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in the development of different size and scale projects related to web development. I would collaborate to develop large-scale interactive sites or applications that would create an incredibly immersive experience.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Laravel, Angular, React Native, SWIFT 5
- üíûÔ∏è I have good experience in the development of various custom projects using WordPress and WooCommerce.
- üì´ Please, if you need my help, just contact me at the following address: radoslav@nikolov.uk
